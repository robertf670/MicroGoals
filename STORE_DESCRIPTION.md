## Full Description

**MicroGoals - Focus on What Matters**

Tired of endless to-do lists that never get done? MicroGoals helps you stay focused on what actually matters. Instead of overwhelming yourself with dozens of tasks, track just a few meaningful goals and watch your progress grow.

**Why MicroGoals?**

Most productivity apps encourage you to add more and more tasks. MicroGoals does the opposite - it limits you to 3 active goals (free) so you can focus your energy where it counts. When you're ready for more, upgrade to premium for up to 30 goals.

**What Makes It Different**

✨ **Visual Progress** - See your progress at a glance with beautiful circular progress rings. Watch that percentage climb as you get closer to your goal.

📊 **Track Everything** - Whether you're reading 300 pages, running 50km, saving money, or learning a new skill - track any numeric goal with custom units.

🎯 **Stay Focused** - The free version limits you to 3 active goals. This isn't a bug - it's a feature. Focus beats multitasking every time.

🎉 **Celebrate Wins** - Get animated celebrations when you complete a goal. You earned it!
